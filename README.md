# [Passes Web Application][passeslink]

_Store your keys and nothing more._<br>
Passes is an application that acts as a password manager to support every type of key, like Passkeys, Passwords, Recovery Keys, Authentication Codes, etc. From the start, Passes, will be end-to-end encrypted, meaning that nothing gets decrypted server side, and no-one but a logged in user can decrypt their own data. Google Anylitics is disabled, and no other anylitics service is included in Passes.
